Chronic stress is a prevalent and widespread issue in our modern society, especially in the current time of social unrest and COVID-19 pandemic. 

Zen Pen is a simple mental health web app designed to help users reduce stress through self-expression and mindfulness meditation. Self-expression, particularly through writing, helps people process their thoughts and grant meaning to adverse experiences. The act of making sense of what happened helps free oneself of ruminations. It also leads to social connections because people who open up to themselves privately about adverse events are more likely to open up to others about them. Meditation, too, has a myriad of research to support its benefits in stress reduction, anxiety control, and emotional health promotion.

Users are able to create, tag, and search for journal entries. They are able to access a library of guided meditation audios, and favorite ones they would like to revisit. Users are also able to view their last seven day activity, as well as set goals to write/meditate.
